![Plain of JARs](http://p.yusukekamiyamane.com/icons/search/fugue/icons-24/jar.png) Plain of JARs
=================

A collection of useful JAR files. 

An installed version of Java (Runtime Environment) 7 is required (some JAR files might also work under Java 6).

Please take a look at the **README in the JARs directory** for further information about the different JAR files. 

Some people might want to use a solution like [JARFix for Windows](http://johann.loefflmann.net/en/software/jarfix/index.html) so they do not need the console part with **cd** and **java -jar**
